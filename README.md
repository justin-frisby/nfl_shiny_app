# nfl_shiny_app
This is a shiny app I created about a year ago for a school assignment in one of my data science classes. I definitely could have added more arguments/parameters to the code to allow for more dynamic filtering or pivoting but it was a great experience. Here is the link to the shiny-app in production, it still works well I just need to update the year to relfect this past season (which falls into that category of additional parameters I could have used): https://justin-frisby.shinyapps.io/nfl_metrics/

I only included the code for the main app.R file and one of the functions (getRushType.r) I use in the app that allows an end-user to pivot rushing yards by run types. I felt as though including all of the ancillary files needed to deploy the app would have been redundant for this purpose.
